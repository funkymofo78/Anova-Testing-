#Ques 1
# carry out an ANOVA to test the hypothesis that the heights of the individuals in the dataset do not vary by site.

mydata <- read.table("Data.txt", header = T)

boxplot(mydata$Height ~ mydata$Site,ylab="Height", xlab="Sites")#create boxplot check assumptions

#Do you think an ANOVA is appropriate in this case and why?

#Yes because we want to compare the means of more than two groups for equality, and we are happy with the
#assumptions of equal variance and normality.

#What is the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis?
#  H0: mu_1=mu_2=mu_3, where mu_i is the pop mean height for site i
#  H1: at least one mu_i differs


#Run the anova test with site in as a factor as it is stored numerically.

anova_height<- aov(Height ~ as.factor(Site),data=mydata)

#Create residual plots to check that the assumptions are met. Open two plots in graphical display, 1 row with
#2 columns. which=1:2 means that we plot the first two residual plots. We are not interested in the third and
#fourth residual plots.

par(mfrow=c(2,1))

#Based on the residuals plots, we are happy to assume normality (from the qqplot), equal variance (from the
                                                                                                 # residuals versus fits plot).
#Print the ANOVA results:

  summary(anova_height)
  
#From the output, are the mean heights the same across all three sites?
#p-value = 0.89 > 0.05 (sig level)
#Therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude there is no significant difference in means for
#height across three different sites.
